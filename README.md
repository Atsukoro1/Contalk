## About The Project
This project is an API for Contalk which is a messaging app similiar to Messenger by Facebook/Meta.

Why i made this project:
* I wanted to make chat application that will bring people together
* Because people want some app that does not collect aditionall data, that are used for advertising purposes. Instead Contalk only collects what it needs to make sure the application will run correctly.
* It was my as a school project for final examination.
